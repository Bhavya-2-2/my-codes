# Automated Log Monitor

## Overview
This project monitors log files in real-time and processes new log entries. It detects changes in the log file and prints the latest entries for analysis.

## Features
- Monitors log files for real-time changes.
- Prints newly added log entries.
- Can be extended for additional log processing or API integration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `watchdog`

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavya-2-2/my-codes.git
   cd automated-log-monitor
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install watchdog
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the log monitor:
   ```bash
   python log_monitor.py
   ```
2. Add new entries to the monitored log file (`logfile.log`), and the script will detect and display the changes.

## Notes
- Replace `logfile.log` with the name of the log file you want to monitor in the script.
- You can further customize the `log_monitor.py` to filter logs or send notifications.
